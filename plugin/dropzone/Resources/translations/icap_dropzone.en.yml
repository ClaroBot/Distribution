PeerReview_helper_ideal_case_example: Example : If two corrections are expected, the evaluation will be totally autonomous only if the number of participants is a multiple of 3. (Student 1 corrects 2 and 3 , Student 2 corrects 1 and 3, Student 3 corrects 1 and 2).

It allows the administrator to avoid to create all the expected corrections (e.g. 3)  if there are no corrections for a copy. This tool is only available when the evaluation is in the "finished" phase.
